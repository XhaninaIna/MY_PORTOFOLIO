        My name is Xhanina Ã‡ela, and I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Business
        Informatics. I have completed specialized training in React JS at
        icubINFO Academy, where I gained a solid foundation in front-end
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on various web development projects, including a MERN Real
        Estate Application, a Travel List Application, and a Shopping Cart
        Application. These experiences allowed me to hone my skills in React,
        JavaScript, and full-stack development using the MERN stack. In my free
        time, I enjoy playing volleyball and listening to music, which help me
        maintain a balanced and active lifestyle.
